# Research-Work: SCR detection / Event detection:
SCR-- Skin Conductance Response
This repo has some of the experiments used in my Mastr's research and thesis. 

***Goal***: The goal of this research was to extract skin conductance events or changes in skin conductances from an ultra-low rate sampled 
Electrodermal activity time series.Due to the ultra-low sampling rates most of the events in the skin conductance time series are lost or have been distorted.Our goal was  to extract or recreate these events from the given downsampled/ultra-lowly sampled time series. 

***Motivation***: The motivation for this work was to increase the battery life for wearables by decreasing the rate at which they sample for changes in skin conductance. 

***The details of the model and the results can be found in the paper/report already uploaded in the repo.***
